# 🌍 Civic Samadhan

**CIVIC SAMADHAN** is a full-stack web application designed for **civic issue reporting, tracking, and resolution**. It bridges the gap between **citizens** and **administrators**, offering transparency, accountability, and data-driven governance.  

The project is divided into two main layers:  
- **Frontend**: A citizen- and admin-facing interface built with modern web standards.  
- **Backend**: A powerful, secure engine handling authentication, complaint lifecycle management, notifications, and analytics.

## 🎨 1. Frontend: A User-Centric Interface  

The frontend provides **distinct experiences for citizens and administrators**.  

### 👤 Citizen Experience  
- **Main Website (`index.html`)** → Landing page with mission, features, and helplines. Includes a **chatbot assistant**.  
- **Complaint Submission (`new-complaint.html`)** → Multi-step guided form with:  
  - Photo & audio upload  
  - Category selection  
  - Location pinning on an interactive map  
- **Issue Tracking (`my-complaints.html`)** → Track submitted complaints with live status, priority, and history.  
- **Local Services (`near-me.html`)** → Map-based discovery of nearby police stations, hospitals, and emergency services.  

### 🛡️ Administrator Experience  
- **Dashboard (`admin-dashboard.html`)** → Overview with charts for:  
  - Complaint categories  
  - Resolution performance  
  - Pending vs resolved counts  
- **Complaint Management (`complaints.html`)** → Tools for:  
  - Filtering by status/category  
  - Viewing complaint details  
  - Updating status or assigning to departments

## ⚙️ 2. Backend: The Power and Security Engine  

The backend is the **intelligent core** of the project, built with **Node.js + Express.js**. It manages all data, authentication, complaint workflows, and system automation.  

### 🔑 Core Functionalities  
- **User Management**  
  - Secure registration/login with hashed passwords (`bcrypt`).  
  - JWT-based authentication with **access & refresh tokens**.  
  - Cryptographic email-based password reset.  

- **Complaint Lifecycle**  
  - New complaint stored in MongoDB with an entry in `ReportHistory`.  
  - Admins can update status, assign departments, or upload resolution images.  
  - Every change logged with timestamp + user ID for auditing.  

### 🔒 Backend-Only Technicalities  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Middleware (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isDepartmentAdmin`) enforces permissions.  
  - Prevents unauthorized actions by regular users.  

- **Automated Cron Jobs**  
  - Run every 15 minutes.  
  - Detect complaints pending >48 hours.  
  - Send **emails + in-app notifications** to officials.  

- **File & Media Handling**  
  - `multer` middleware validates uploads (size & type).  
  - Files stored in **Cloudinary**; local temp files auto-deleted.  

- **Analytics Engine**  
  - MongoDB aggregation pipelines compute:  
    - Total complaints  
    - Average resolution time  
    - Department performance  
  - Metrics update automatically on report changes.

## 👣 Typical Workflow  

1. **Citizen Onboarding**  
   - Register/login → JWT tokens issued.  
   - Passwords securely hashed.  

2. **Complaint Filing**  
   - Citizen submits complaint with media + location.  
   - Stored in DB → logged in `ReportHistory`.  

3. **Admin Management**  
   - Admin views complaints, updates status, assigns departments.  
   - Immutable audit logs maintained.  

4. **Automated Oversight**  
   - Cron jobs flag overdue complaints.  
   - Notifications ensure accountability.  

5. **Citizen Tracking**  
   - Citizens check status via "My Complaints".  
   - Resolution history always accessible.
